# clojuresque â€“ a Clojure plugin for Gradle

## What is Gradle?

[Gradle][] is a build system written in Java and [Groovy][]. One advantage
of [Gradle][] is, that the build script itself is also a [Groovy][] script.
That means whatever can be done in [Groovy][] can be done in the build
script. This is useful to abstract away common patterns in the build like
repetition or conditional decisions.

On top of that [Gradle][] provides a convenient build system which comes
in form of different plugins. Each plugin defines certain conventions which
(if followed) automasie 95% of the build completely. Still the conventions
are freely configurable to be adapted to different project structures.

## What is clojuresque?

[clojuresque][cg] is now a plugin for [Gradle][], which adds [Clojure][clj]
support. It allows compilation with automatic namespace recognition. The
plugin is based on the Java plugin and hooks into the standard configurations
and archives.

Contrary to the [Groovy][] plugin, there is no special `groovy` configuration.
Java code in the same project might want to hook into [Clojure][] as well. So
the [Clojure][] jar must be available also to the Java portion of the project.

## Caveats

* Automatic recognition of namespaces only works if the `ns` form is the
  first in the file. Comments may precede the form. The symbol is allowed
  to be fully qualified: `clojure.core/ns`.

## Usage

Create a `build.gradle` script in the root directory of your project. *Note
that gradle derives the project name from the name of this directory!*

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            maven { url 'http://clojars.org/repo' }
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath 'clojuresque:clojuresque-base:1.6.0'
        }
    }
    
    group = 'example.group'
    version = '1.0.0'
    
    apply plugin: 'clojure-min'
    
    clojure {
        warnOnReflection = true
        aotCompile = true
    }
    
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        compile 'org.clojure:clojure:1.5.1'
    }

## Filter

In the filesets you can specify filters with `include` resp. `exclude`.
This is fine for mostly file based languages. However clojure is strongly
based on namespaces. Therefor the clojure part of the source sets support
also `clojureIncludeNamespace` and `clojureExcludeNamespace` which can be
used to filter on the namespace name. Eg. to exclude examples from the
final jar one could use

    sourceSets.main.clojure {
        clojureExcludeNamespace 'my.project.examples.**.*'
    }

## Issues

This is **alpha** software! Expect problems! Please report issues in the
bugtracker at [bitbucket][bb]. Or email them to me.

General support is available on the [clojuresque google group][cgg].
